Feature Weighting for Machine Learning Models

1. [WeightedML.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/Tingfang-W/Feature-Engineering-ML/blob/main/WeightedML.ipynb): This Jupyter notebook contains the code for implementing the weighted machine learning methods. It demonstrates how to apply mutual information to weight features for various classifiers and evaluates the performance of these methods on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.
   
2. [Methodical Details](Methodical_Details.pdf): This PDF file contains the methodological details, including an explanation of the techniques used in the notebook and theoretical background on mutual information-based feature weighting.
